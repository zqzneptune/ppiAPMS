# ppiAPMS
This is an R package that implements statistical modeling approaches that assign confidence scores to protein-protein interaction data generated using affinity purificationâ€“mass spectrometry (AP-MS), typically label-free quantitative data.
ppiAPMS consists of a series of wrapper functions for assigning confidence scores to protein-protein interactions based on quantitative proteomics data in AP-MS experiments.
